This is a practice tech test in Makers course week 10. If you came here looking for the solution... why are you doing that? You won't learn by copying.

I decided to use JavaScript, to revise after two weeks of Ruby, and the Jasmine testing framework since I wasn't going to be using a browser (REPL interface, so Node.js runtime environment). I decided to follow the [Google JavaScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javascriptguide.xml), checking this with the [associated ESLint config](https://github.com/google/eslint-config-google).
